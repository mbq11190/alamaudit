Final Authorization (1.7) - Feature Notes

Purpose:
- Provides partner-level formal authorization for engagement acceptance.
- Validates a set of mandatory checks (provisioned by ISQM/ISA) before allowing Planning to unlock.

Key behaviors:
- A transient wizard collects decision, rationale, EQCR assignment, competence attestations, and a flag to generate certificate/summary pack.
- System enforces preconditions before authorization: profile completeness, AML/fit-proper checks, independence compliance, predecessor clearance, proposed fee present, resources & competence confirmation, and high-risk resolution.
- If decision = Decline, onboarding is locked and a decline memo is generated/attached.
- If decision = Accept (or Conditional), onboarding transitions to partner_approved and optional certificate/summary pack are produced and attached.
- Conditions (when conditional acceptance chosen) are stored as records and can be tracked separately.

Configuration & Notes:
- The summary pack is generated by merging available PDF memos/attachments using the same PDF merger as the Predecessor pack.
- For conditional acceptance, a policy decision about planning unlock can be enforced via the wizard (currently supports 'locked' or 'partial').
